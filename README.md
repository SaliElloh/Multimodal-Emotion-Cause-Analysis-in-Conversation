## Description:
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for analyzing emotions in conversations using natural language processing techniques. The project is part of SemEval 2024 Task 3: The Competition of Multimodal Emotion Cause Analysis in Conversations.

## Files:

### text_analysis.ipynb:

* This notebook focuses on text-based emotion recognition.
* Implements baseline statistical models such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine for emotion classification using text data.
* Explores various preprocessing techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, and stop word removal.
* Evaluates models based on F1 scores for individual emotions and a weighted average.

### audio_analysis.ipynb:

* This notebook aims to analyze emotions in conversations using audio data.
* Implements audio feature extraction techniques such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and pitch.
* Utilizes machine learning models like SVM and neural networks for emotion classification based on audio features.
* Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices.

### base_model.ipynb:

* This notebook serves as the baseline model for emotion recognition in conversations.
* Implements a basic statistical model (e.g., logistic regression) for emotion classification.
* Provides a starting point for comparing the performance of more advanced models implemented in other notebooks.
* Contains essential preprocessing steps and data visualization techniques for understanding the dataset.
* 
## Instructions:

Run each notebook individually to understand the specific analysis and implementation.
